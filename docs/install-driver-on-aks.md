## Install open source CSI driver on AKS cluster

> When CSI driver is enabled, built-in in-tree driver(`kubernetes.io/azure-disk`) should not be used any more since there is potential race condition when both in-tree and CSI drivers are working.

 - Prerequisites

AKS cluster is created with user assigned identity(with naming rule [`AKS Cluster Name-agentpool`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity#summary-of-managed-identities)) on agent node pool by default, make sure that identity has `Contributor` role on node resource group, follow below instruction to set up `Contributor` role on node resource group
